Kalibro Processor is a source code analysis web service which is also part of the Mezuro project. It is free software under the AGPLv3 license.

It was strongly based on the vintage Kalibro (https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro) written in Java mostly by Carlos Morais (carlos88morais at gmail dot com) on his MSc dissertation (in portuguese http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-25092013-142158/en.php)

=== Development


* System dependencies (Ubuntu package names)

  * build-essential

  * curl

  * postgresql-server-dev-9.1

  *NOTE:* The version of postgresql may vary according to your system version

* Ruby version

  2.3.0

  You can easily install it through the Ruby Version Manager - RVM. Instructions on how to do it can be found at http://rvm.io

  *NOTE:* If you are using the gnome-shell, or any derivative like terminator, you have to mark on your profile the option to use a "login bash".


* Configuration

    ./bin/setup

  This will create all the configuration files with defaults for Ubuntu and initialize your database.

  * Local environment

      RAILS_ENV=local ./bin/setup

    This is an environment used when you want to run the server for acceptance tests from other services like Prezento. It uses a delayed_job queue for processings. So in order to process, run:

      RAILS_ENV=local rake jobs:work

* How to run the test suite

    rake

  *NOTE:* For this you will need the Kalibro Configurations service up and running as explained below.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

  * Kalibro Configurations
    * You can find it at https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro_configurations
    * By default Mezuro will expect it to be running on port 8083 at localhost.
    * In order to run it as expected, run on two different terminal instances: ```rails s -p 8083```.

* Deployment instructions

  Deployment is made through Capistrano (https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)

    cap production deploy

  In order to do this, you must have your ssh key set at the target server.

  Otherwise, you can also modify the deployment file at <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt>.

=== Install

* First Deploy

  1. Make sure that the deployment files (<tt>config/deploy.rb</tt> <tt>config/deploy/production.rb</tt> are correctly configured at the server;
  2. Also, make sure that your server already has rvm installed;
    * It should already have the ruby version installed with the gemset created as well
  3. Check if everything is OK for deploy:
      cap production deploy:check
  4. Finally deploy with:
      cap production deploy
