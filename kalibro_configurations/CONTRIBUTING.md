### Contributing

Please, have a look the wiki pages about development workflow and code standards:

  - https://github.com/mezuro/mezuro/wiki/Development-workflow
  - https://github.com/mezuro/mezuro/wiki/Standards

Also, we have configured [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) to make it easier for developers to apply our code standards.

You can run `rake rubocop` and look for offenses.
